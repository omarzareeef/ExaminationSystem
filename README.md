# ExaminationSystem
I worked in a team of 2 members. this is an **Examination System _Database_** with 4 roles. Admin. Training Manager for all Management processes (Track, Department, Student, Instructor, Course...). Instructor can add Exams for his course, assign specific students for this exam as maybe it will be corrective and manage his course question pool. students can do the exam. The system automatically checks students' answers and calculate exam scores. Question pool contain three types of questions (Multiple Choice, True False and Text Questions), bonus here is we check student answer to text question with function that measure string similarity. Our System depends on Stored procedure that no one will write any queries, just the procedure Call.
